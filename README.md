# Machine-learning-Project
# Regression analysis on Black Friday dataset (Dataset from Kaggle competition) (Using Python)
 
 Started off from the scratch by cleaning the data, analyzing and visualization, feature selection, Built four different regression models â€“ Ridge regression, Polynomial regression, Decision tree regressor and Random forest regressor. Learnt the difference in their approach towards the type of data. Fine-tuned the parameters for the same estimators using Grid search CV and Random search CV and rebuilt the models and notice the difference in their R2 score.
Thorough understanding of the above regression methods and their usage.
